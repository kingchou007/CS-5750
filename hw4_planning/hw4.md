# Homework 4: Planning

## Overview 
In this project, you will implement both A* and RRT planning algorithms for the MuSHR car and the Widowx250 arm robot. While this sounds intimidating, you will soon realize that planning algorithms can be easily generalized to different platforms.

## Section 1: A* and RRT (40 points for Undergrads, 50 points for Grads)

### Code Overview
The first step of motion planning is to define the problem space (`src/planning/problems.py`). This section only considers `PlanarProblems`: `R2Problem`. The `R2Problem` configuration space only considers the x- and y- positions. The `PlanarProblem` class implements shared functionality, such as collision-checking. The specific problems implement their own distance and steering functions to connect two configurations. After defining these classes, the rest of your planning algorithm can abstract away these particulars of the configuration space. (To solve a new type of problem, just implement a corresponding problem class.)

The Roadmap class contains many useful methods and fields. Three fields are particularly important: `graph`, `vertices`, and `weighted_edges`. `Roadmap.graph` is a [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) graph, either `undirected` or `directed` depending on the problem type. The starter code already handles interacting with this object. Nodes in the NetworkX graph have integer labels. These are indices into `Roadmap.vertices`, a NumPy array of configurations corresponding to each node in the graph. `Roadmap.weighted_edges` is a NumPy array of edges and edge weights; each row `(u, v, w)` describes an edge where `u` and `v` are the same integer-labeled nodes and `w` is the weight (length for R2) of the edge between them.

### Q1. Searching on R2 Problems using A* (25 points)
In this problem, we will write the A* planning algorithm for a roadmap. Roadmaps are already provided - to visualize a simple roadmap, run the following command:

```
roscd planning
python3 scripts/roadmap --saveto "test/share/map1.pkl" -m test/share/map1.txt --show-edges
```

<figure>

 <figcaption> Figure 1: A simple roadmap </figcaption>
</figure> 
<br/><br/>

The A* algorithm expands nodes in order of their f-value $f(n) = g(n) + h(n)$, where $g(n)$ is the estimated cost-to-come to the node $n$ and $h(n)$ is the estimated cost-to-go from the node $n$ to the goal. For this problem, we will use the Euclidean distance for both cost-to-come and cost-to-go.


**Q1.1** Implement the `distance_between_states` function for `R2Problem` class in `planning/src/planning/problems.py`. Your implementation should compute the Euclidean distance between corresponding elements of two arrays of states in R2 space. Note that both `cost_to_come` and `cost_to_go` make use of `distance_between_states`. While `cost_to_come` uses it to compute the cost estimate between states, `cost_to_go` uses it to compute the heuristic cost.  

You can verify your implementation on the provided test suites by running `python3 test/problems.py`.

**Q1.2:** Implement the main A* logic in `planning/src/planning/search.py`. For each neighbor, check if it hasn't been expanded yet, and if so, compute the cost-to-come of the neighbor node via the current node (cost-to-come for the current node, plus the length of the edge to the neighbor). Next, compute the f-value of the neighbor node (cost-to-come plus heuristic). Insert a `QueueEntry` with this information into the [priority queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue) (You can learn more about our provided priority queue in `search.py` line 15-24). Then, implement `extract_path` to follow the parent pointers from the goal to the start; this function is called by A* after the goal has been expanded to finally return the sequence of nodes.

You can verify your implementation on the provided test suites by running `python3 test/astar.py`. Your implementation should pass the `test_astar_r2problem` suites.

You should now be able to run an A* planner from the start to the goal! The following command specifies that it is an `R2Problem`, planning from the start of (1, 6) to the goal of (9, 3). Your plot should match the reference plot below.

```
python3 scripts/run_astar -m test/share/map1.txt -n 25 -r 3.0 --show-edges r2 -s 1 6 -g 9 3
```

Compute the shortest path on map2.txt between (252, 115) and (350, 350) with the following command: 

```
python3 scripts/run_astar -m test/share/map2.txt -n 600 -r 100 r2 -s 252 115 -g 350 350 
```

### Q2. Searching on R2 Problems using RRT (15 points for Undergrads, 25 points for Grads)

You will be implementing a Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT) for the same 2D world. For more details on the algorithm, refer to the reading material on the course website. The main algorithms are to be implemented in `RRTPlanner` class in `planning/src/planning/search.py`. A class called `RRTTree` is implemented in `planning/src/planning/RRTTree.py`.

**Q2.1** Implement the main RRT logic in `planning/src/planning/search.py`.  First, implement the `extend` function in class `RRTPlanner`. Then, complete the `Plan` function. Specifically, you will need to sample a random point and add vertex/edge accordingly.  

You should now be able to run a RRT planner from the start to the goal! The following command specifies that it is an R2Problem, planning from the start of (1, 6) to the goal of (9, 3). Your plot should match the reference plot below.

```
roscd planning
python3 scripts/run_rrt -m test/share/map1.txt -s 1 6 -g 9 3 --show-tree
```
> The --show-tree flag allows you to visualize the growing of your tree in real time. You can also specify how many random samples you want to draw at each iteration by specifying `-size n`, where n is the number of samples. You can also specify step size eta using the flag `-e`.

Your implementation is expected to pass `python3 test/rrt.py`. 

Run RRT on map2.txt to find the path between (252, 115) and (350, 350) with the following command: 

```
python3 scripts/run_rrt -m test/share/map2.txt -s 252 115 -g 350 250 --show-tree -size 100 
```

Include the figure visualizing the RRT path in your submission in `planning/writeup/`.

**Q2.2 (For graduate students only)** RRT planner's output is usually not optimal, and some postprocessing is required. Implement the `ShortenPath()` function in `planning/src/planning/search.py`. 

Once you finish, add flag `--shortcut` to visualize new plan. Shortcuts will be shown in color green.

```
python3 scripts/run_rrt -m test/share/map1.txt -s 1 6 -g 9 3 --show-tree --shortcut
```
Your plot should match the reference plot below.

## Section 2: Planning for Car (10 points)

### Q3. Searching on SE(2) using AStar (10 points)

So far, weâ€™ve been solving `R2Problems`. But since the MuSHR cars have an orientation, the problems we need to solve are `SE2Problems`, which concerns about both x, y position, and orientation. Thus, your NetworkX graph will have directed edges. The [Dubins path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubins_path) connects two configurations, with a maximum specified curvature<sup>[1](#1)</sup>. Since the Dubins path is directed, the graph will be directed. As a result, more vertices are generally needed for the graph to be connected.

Implement the `distance_between_states` function for `SE2Problem` in `planning/src/planning/problems.py` (remember to make use of `dubins.path_length()`). Your implementation should compute the cost estimate between two states in SE2 space. Note that both `cost_to_go` and `cost_to_come` use `distance_between_states` to compute the cost estimate between states, and heuristic cost respectively. 

You can verify your implementation on the provided test suites by running `python3 test/astar.py`. Your implementation should pass the `test_astar_se2problem` suites. 

To visualize planned path with Dubins path as edges, run
```
python3 scripts/run_astar -m test/share/map1.txt -n 40 -r 4 --show-edges se2 -s 1 6 0 -g 9 3 45 -c 3
```
Your plot should match the reference plot below.

  <figcaption>Figure 5: AStar SE(2) path in blue on map1.txt, from (1, 6) in green to (9, 3) in red.</figcaption>
</figure> 
<br/><br/>

After you have successfully implemented the `distance_between_states` function for `SE2Problem`, you should be able to use A* to plan the path for MuSHR car in the maze roadmap.

```
roslaunch car_planning planner_sim.launch map:='$(find cs4750)/maps/maze_0.yaml' num_vertices:=1000 connection_radius:=10 curvature:=1 
```
Then, in rviz, select "2D Nav Goal" and click/drag on the map.

## Section 3: Planning for Widowx 250 Arm (40 points)

Open a terminal and run 
```
roslaunch widowx250_moveit_config widowx_simple_env.launch use_rviz:=true
```
You should see a widowx250 arm is placed next to a table. In this section, you will plan various paths for widowx250 while avoiding hitting the table and floor.

</figure> 
<br/><br/>

At this point, you have successfully implemented both RRT and A* planning algorithms. As you may know, these algorithms are not restricted to any platforms. In fact, they are widely use in robot arms as well. Robot arms are different from a car in many ways. Most importantly, we are working with a higher dimensional configuration space. Hence, the definition of distance and heuristics will be different from the car example. 

### Q4: Design heuristic function for A* for planning with Widowx 250 Arm (20 points)
In this assignment, let's interpret the distance between two robot arm configurations as changes in joint angles. Note that the distance between two joint states has been defined as the sum of absolute change in each joint angle (`JointSpace.cost_to_come` in `planning/src/planning/problems.py`). Come up with your own admissible heuristic function to the target configuration in `JointSpace.cost_to_go` (`planning/src/planning/problems.py`). A heuristic is said to be admissible if it never overestimates the cost of reaching the goal (and is non-negative). As in previous question, we have provided you a roadmap to search in. Note that the joints in this robot arm are assumed to have bidirectional motion, i.e., they can rotate in either direction. Make sure to take into account warping around 2*pi for joint angles in your implementation. 

To visualize your A* planning algorithm
```
# In terminal 1, run
roslaunch widowx250_moveit_config widowx_simple_env.launch use_rviz:=true

# In terminal 2, run
rosrun arm_planning astar_planning -s 0 0 0 0 0 0 -g -2.3472 0.9303 -0.8133 1.6733 0.8535 -1.7264
```

Once a path is found, waypoints of the planned path will be displayed in Rviz. Feel free to use the `Trajectory Slider` in the left bottom pannel of Rviz to visualize your plan sequentially (If the slider did not load the latest trajectory, close it and restart by going to `Panels` (top left of RViz window) -> `Motion Planning - Trajectory Slider`).

After successfully implementing the heuristic function, you should pass all tests when you run

```
# In terminal 1, run
roslaunch widowx250_moveit_config widowx_simple_env.launch use_rviz:=true

# In terminal 2, run
python3 arm_planning/test/problems_arm.py
```
In `planning/writeup/README.md`, briefly tell us how did you design your heuristic function.

### Q5: Design distance function for RRT (20 points)

Let's say we have a robotic arm that executes motion in each joint at different joint velocities, which we represent by $v$. You are asked to design a distance function for RRT that aims to find the path which can be executed in minimum time given these different velocities. Note that the time spent in executing the motion from source state $q1$ to target state $q2$ is the maximum of absolute change in each joint angle divided by the joint velocity: 

$$ Time\ spent\ in\ executing\ motion\ from\ q1\ to\ q2 = \max_{i=1 to 6} abs((q1[i] - q2[i])/v[i]) $$ 

Note that we haven't shown warping around 2\*pi in the above equation for concision. Make sure to take that into account in your implementation. Suppose that these joint velocities are `1.0`, `1.2`, `0.8`, `0.75`, `1.05`, and `0.9` for joints `waist`,`shoulder`, `elbow`, `forearm_roll`, `wrist_pitch`, and `wrist_roll` respectively. Design a distance function (`JointSpace.compute_distance()`) in `planning/src/planning/problems.py` such that RRT uses the time spent in executing the motion from source state to target state as the cost estimate these two states. 

After implementing your cost function, test it and see what path it will find!

```
# In terminal 1, run
roslaunch widowx250_moveit_config widowx_simple_env.launch use_rviz:=true

# In terminal 2, run
rosrun arm_planning rrt_planning -s 0 0 0 0 0 0 -g -2.3472 0.9303 -0.8133 1.6733 0.8535 -1.7264 -e 0.5 
# different step size, eta

```

After successfully implementing the heuristic function, you should pass all tests when you run

```
# In terminal 1, run
roslaunch widowx250_moveit_config widowx_simple_env.launch use_rviz:=true

# In terminal 2, run
python3 arm_planning/test/custom_distance_rrt.py
